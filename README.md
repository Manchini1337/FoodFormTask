# Food Form Recruitment Task
## Live Preview
The application has been deployed to Github Pages and is accessible to anyone.
Open [https://manchini1337.github.io/FoodFormTask/](https://manchini1337.github.io/FoodFormTask/) to view it in the browser.
Basic response information is displayed in the components (in case of both success and errors), however I've left full response available in the console. 

## Required information

Node and NPM Versions:
- Node: v16.17.1
- NPM: v8.19.1

It took me around 10 hours to complete the solution. That includes planning and setting up tests for the application.

## Getting started with the application
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install` 

That command will install all defined dependencies, and generate a node_modules folder with the installed modules. This process is mandatory.

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://127.0.0.1:5173/FoodFormTask/](http://127.0.0.1:5173/FoodFormTask/) to view it in the browser.


### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner. The addition of '--verbose' flag displays individual test results with the test suite hierarchy.
